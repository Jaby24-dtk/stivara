// makes the cookie eligible for third-party contexts; `Partitioned` (CHIPS)
// keeps it scoped to the embedding top-level site instead of becoming a
// bare third-party cookie, so this doesn't hand out a broader session than
// before — same auth cookie, now readable from within the STIV embed too.
